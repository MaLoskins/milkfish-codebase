A sleek, lightweight visualization tool that transforms your Python codebase into an interactive network graph, revealing connections between files, classes, methods, and functions. Perfect for identifying "floating nodes" ‚Äì forgotten or unrealized components in your projects.

## üöÄ Features

- **Holistic Code Analysis**: See your entire codebase as an interconnected network
- **Relationship Discovery**: Visualize how components connect and interact
- **Floating Node Detection**: Quickly identify unused or disconnected code
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Lightweight**: No heavy dependencies or frameworks
- **Dark Mode UI**: Easy on the eyes for those late-night coding sessions

## üîß Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maloskins/python-codebase-visualizer.git
   cd python-codebase-visualizer
   ```

2. **Start a local server**
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in HTTP server
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open in your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Analyze your codebase**
   - Click "Choose Directory" to select a directory of Python files
   - Or click "Load Sample Code" to see the visualizer in action with example files
   - Explore the generated graph, zoom in/out, and click on nodes to see detailed information

## üß† The Story Behind

Developed by [Matthew Haskins](https://github.com/Maloskins) during a PyGame project to identify forgotten components of the game, this tool emerged from my research in Geometric Neural Networks. I needed a way to quality-check code from a more holistic perspective ‚Äì seeing relationships that aren't immediately obvious when looking at individual files.

## ü§ñ AI Development Tool

This visualizer serves as an excellent tool for AI agents involved in code generation:

- **Hallucination Prevention**: By visualizing the entire codebase, AI can verify that generated components connect properly to existing code
- **Redundancy Detection**: Easily spot duplicate functionality or unused code that AI might generate
- **Architecture Alignment**: Ensure AI-generated code follows the established project structure and patterns
- **Verification**: Provides a feedback mechanism to verify that AI-generated code integrates as expected

## üíª Technical Details

- **Front-end**: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Visualization**: D3.js for the force-directed graph
- **Parser**: Custom JavaScript parser for Python code analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Works on devices of all sizes
- **No Backend Required**: Runs entirely in the browser
